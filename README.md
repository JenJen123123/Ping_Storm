# Ping_Storm
A Bash tool called PingStorm that measures and compares internet latency to several major online services (like Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc.). The tool will simulate a basic "speed test" by checking how quickly each of these websites responds to a ping, then analyze and visualize the results.
